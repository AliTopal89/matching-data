# matching-data

this exercise was from January 17, 2015 Pythonlab class. Owner of the data and coding is Rami Chowdhury, github.com/necaris 

Rami used generatedata.com (I recommend anyone to play around with this website, it is useful to practice your skills with any scripting and programming languages). We had 2 data sets. Name-bank-email psv file and name-address file. In this class we matched the two sets together.

In this matching data exercise I used IP[y]: Notebook. One important part of this exercise is the path of the data. 
I wanted to share this example with the rest that is using IP[y]: Notebook. You can see how the code looks like in match-data.py

Why I like IP[y]: Notebook is because it is compatible with the terminal shell (kind of like how github is) Everytime you hit save you can see the same process on your terminal shell. Furthermore, when you make an error I think the way the error message is displayed is clearer.
