# matching-data

this exercise was from January 17, 2015 Pythonlab class. Owner of the data and coding is Rami Chowdhury, github.com/necaris 
In this matching data exercise I used IP[y]: Notebook. One important part of this exercise is the path of the data. 
I wanted to share this example with the rest that is using IP[y]: Notebook. You can see an how the code looks like in match-data.py

Why I prefer IP[y]: Notebook is because the it is compatible with the terminal shell. Everytime you hit save you can see the same process on your terminal shell. Furthermore, when you make an error I think the way the error message is displayed is clearer.
